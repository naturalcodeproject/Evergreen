What is Evergreen?
Evergreen is more of an idea than a thing. It is the idea that there are a lot of benefits to having some structure to your code and to having some things done for you already but that a lot of frameworks have taken that to far. We are developers and know how to do development, a lot of other frameworks will have interfaces that interact with things like sessions and email that are already built into the system which come with the framework no matter what you want. To us this idea is not what a framework should be about so with Evergreen we endeavor to provide the developer with a base to work off of that will empower the developer to do what they want and have what they want in the project that they are building.

Evergreen the idea has been realized so far in the form of a PHP framework built on the idea of simplicity and ease of use by all parties involved. It is heavily based on the MVC design pattern which has become a standard among frameworks for its robustness, code reuse, and organization.
